# Sequences and auto-provisioning

In the ArtifactDB world, data and metadata files are organized in projects, then versions. This means project must have
unique IDs across them, and versions within a single project must also be unique. There are different options achieving
this requirement: external provisioning vs. auto-provisioning.

## External provisioning

The uniqueness of projects ID and versions are left to the client interfacing wit the ArtifactDB instance. This is
useful for instance when these identifiers are stored and managed in an external system. The instance will not provision
any IDs, nor will it ensure an existing project is not being overwritten. It just trusts and follow the directions
communicated by the client.

## Auto-provisioning

When this component is enabled, a `artifactdb.backend.components.sequences.SequenceManager` is created and attached to
the backend manager. This manager holds one or more `artifactdb.backend.components.sequences.SequenceClient` responsible
to provision project identifiers, and for each, unique versions, in a transactional way. The underlying implementation
involves a SQL database and a sequence (if Postgres), so the name. The library `sqlalchemy` is used for the SQL database
operations. A sequence for a project ID is usually defined as a project prefix (eg. `PRJ`, `DS`, etc...), while the
version is based on on incremented integer, per project.

### Synchronizing

Following one of the core principle of ArtifactDB, "the storage (like s3) is the source of truth", the whole SQL
database content can be derived from the storage content. Projects and their versions are listed and used to populate
the initial content. During that "sync" operation, the table containing the actual sequence information is locked, to
prevent any concurrent writing (a new project being created while syncing the sequences). Any request for provisioning,
ie. any upload requests, will hang until the sequence content is restored from the storage. This operation can take a
long time, and the instance should be put in a maintenance mode to inform users new uploads should be postponed.

Each `SequenceClient` is associated, per configuration (see below), to one sequence content. The synchronization process
is performed from the sequence client, which means if multiple sequences are declared (eg. multiple prefixes), each can
be synchornized independently from the others.

### Pools

Pools declare intervals to contrain project identifiers values. They come in two different flavors:

- *provisioned pool*: declares an inclusive interval within which a project ID will be provisioned. There can be only
  one active provisioned pool, if a new provisioned pool is created, the previous one will set to `inactive`.
- *restricted pool*: declares an inclusive interval within which a project ID is *not* allowed to be provisioned. There
  can be multiple restricted pools at a time.

Restricted pools can overlap a provisioned pool, in which case the overlapped IDs are removed from the provisioning
process (in other words, restricted pools have precedence over provisioned pools).

When starting for the first time, the ArtifactDB instance will create a provisioned pool ranging from 1 up to
`max_sequence_id`, with 999'999'999 being the default, if `auto_create_pool` is true (default). See the
[section](Configuration) below for more on sequence configuration).

### Interfaces

#### API endooint

The sequence information (project ID and version) are used while uploading artifacts, see section [upload](usage/upload)
for more. Other endpoints can be used to collect information about the different sequences state. These require by
default the role `admin`.

- `GET /sequences` returns exhautive information for all sequence clients, including the project prefix, the provisioned
  and restricted pools, the last provisioned ID, etc...
- `GET /sequences/{project_id}/current_version` can be used to obtain the last version assigned to a give project ID.

#### Configuration

Using a sequence requires to declare a list of configuration elements. Each element of that list will produce a
`SequenceClient`. The `uri`, `db_user`, `db_password` and `schema_name` parameters specify the database access are
roughly passed to `sqlalchemy.create_engine(...)` function. The remaining parameters drive the sequence behavior,
specifically the project ID naming.

The whole sequence configuration is declared under the root key `sequence`, containing a list of configuration elements,
one element per sequence client:

```yaml
sequence:
  # sequence client 1
  - uri: ...
    db_user: ...
    ...
  # sequence client 2
  - uri: ...
    db_user: ...
```

The sequence client can configured with the following parameter:

| Parameter        | Description |
| ---------        | ----------- |
| `uri`            | sqlalchemy compliant database URI |
| `db_user`        |Â username used for the database connection |
| `db_password `   | password for that user (using "!include /path/to/secret" tag is recommended (TODO: link to config)|
| `schema_name`    | schema name (postgres), or database name (mysql) |
| `project_prefix` | short prefix for all project IDs, eg. PROJ, DS, etc...
| `project_format` | project format rule, as f-string, ex: 'f"{project_prefix}{seq_id:09}"'. `seq_id` is passed by the
|                  |  sequence client itself and corresponds to the incremented integer returned by the SQL sequence itself.
|                  |  The whole f-string is then `eval`'d to obtain the final result. The version format is left to the
|                  |  sequence client implementation (default is an incremented integer). |
| `max_sequence_id` | upper limit for the project ID, defaulting to 999999999 |
| `version_first`   | specifies the first version to provision for a new project, defaulting to "1" |
| `auto_create_pool`  | upon fresh start, auto-create provisioned pool from [1,max_sequence_id] |
| `default`         | if no sequence prefix is specified, instruct the `SequenceManager` to use this sequence by
|                   | default |
| `debug`           | activate SQL debug statements for troubleshooting |


Also see `artifact.config.sequences` module and `SequenceConfig` class for more.

#### Administration

Sequences can be manipulated from an *admin* shell to perform maintenance operations. Because these operations are rare
and critical, there are not available through endpoints. Let's see some examples.

**Manipulating provisioned and restricted pool**

```
# list sequence clients
> mgr.sequence_manager.clients
{'RDB': <SequenceClient (schema='rdbseq_dev_rdb', prefix='RDB', default=True)>,
 'test-RDB': <SequenceClient (schema='rdbseq_dev_test_rdb', prefix='test-RDB', default=False)>}
# fetch the sequence client we're interested in
> seq_client = mgr.sequence_manager.clients["RDB"]
# list existing pools
> seq_client.list_provisioned_pools()
[{'pool_id': 1,
  'pool_type': 'PROVISIONED',
  'pool_status': 'ACTIVE',
  'lower_limit': 2,
  'upper_limit': 999999999,
  'created_at': datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 21, 19, 47, 5, 898703, tzinfo=psycopg2.tz.FixedOffsetTimezone(offset=0, name=None))}]
> seq_client.list_restricted_pools()
[]
# check current project ID
> seq_client.current_id()
"RDB000000003"
# obtain a new one
> seq_client.next_id()
'RDB000000004'
# the next one would 5, etc... Let's restrict this and forbids provisioning from [5,1O]
> seq_client.create_restricted_pool(5,10)
> seq_client.list_restricted_pools()
[{'pool_id': 2,
  'pool_type': 'RESTRICTED',
  'pool_status': 'ACTIVE',
  'lower_limit': 5,
  'upper_limit': 10,
  'created_at': datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 27, 17, 31, 55, 92508, tzinfo=psycopg2.tz.FixedOffsetTimezone(offset=0, name=None))}]
# the restricted pool overlaps the provisioned one, next ID is...
> seq_client.next_id()
'RDB000000011'
# indeed, not 5 but 11! Let's create a new provisioned pool
> seq_client.create_provisioned_pool(100, 200)
# list all provisioned, regardless of `pool_status`
 seq_client.list_provisioned_pools(pool_status=None)
Out[16]:
[{'pool_id': 3,
  'pool_type': 'PROVISIONED',
  'pool_status': 'ACTIVE',
  'lower_limit': 100,
  'upper_limit': 200,
  'created_at': datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 27, 17, 33, 38, 519968, tzinfo=psycopg2.tz.FixedOffsetTimezone(offset=0, name=None))},

  'pool_type': 'PROVISIONED',
  'pool_status': 'INACTIVE',

  'upper_limit': 999999999,
  'created_at': datetime.datetime(2022, 6, 21, 19, 47, 5, 898703, tzinfo=psycopg2.tz.FixedOffsetTimezone(offset=0, name=None))}]
# the old one is now inactive, the new one active. Next ID is...
> seq_client.next_id()
'RDB000000100'
```

**Synchronizing sequence content**
If there was an issue, such as loosing the SQL database, wrong manipulation of pools, or when an instance content was
taken from another instance (eg. `aws s3 sync ...` between buckets), potential resulting in a desync with the sequence
content, we can ask for a given sequence client to restore its content from the storage.

```
# we'll sync only the `RDB` sequence for example
> seq_client = mgr.sequence_manager.clients["RDB"]
# dry-run to first have a look at the situation
> seq_client.sync(dryrun=True)
DEBUG:root:Active storage: <S3Client bucket=some-bucket>
DEBUG:root:Listing all projects in s3 starting with RDB
...
DEBUG:root:Listing artifacts/versions currently in sequence
...
Do you want to initialize the sequence 'RDB' with the following content? [y/N]
...
(some information about pools the sequence wants to create to match the storage content)
...

y
Let's go...
DEBUG:root:Skipping creation of provision pool
INFO:root:Dry-run mode, rolling back
# remove dry_run to proceed for real
> seq_client.sync()
...
```
